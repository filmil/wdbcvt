# Values over time: arenas, pages and records

The values of every object live in zlib compressed pages at the end of
the file.
Each page holds a run of records, and each record is a time, an object
key and the object's whole new value.
The pages are grouped into arenas, and an arena is found through the
page directory described in [container.md](container.md).

Everything below is a measurement on files written by Vivado 2025.2.
Reproduce any of it with:

```sh
bazel build //hdl/corpus:all_wdb
bazel run //cmd/wdbcvt -- -dump -in "$PWD/bazel-bin/hdl/corpus/t5_tr1000_______/sim.wdb"
```


## Handles, arenas and keys

Every object carries a 64 bit handle in its instance record, see
[hierarchy.md](hierarchy.md).
The handle splits in two:

| Bits | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `handle >> 11` | arena index, into the arena table and the page directory |
| `handle & 0x7ff` | key, the number a value record carries |

Found by `t5_sig10`, the first case with more than one arena for
signals.
Its ten handles run from `0x768` in steps of `0xf0`, so `s0` is
`0x768` in arena 0 with key `0x768`, and `s1` is `0x858` in arena 1
with key `0x58`.
The dump of `t2_flat3` shows the same split at three objects:
`tb.alpha` in arena 0 with key `0x768`, `tb.bravo` and `tb.charlie` in
arena 1 with keys `0x58` and `0x148`.

An arena is a window of `0x800` handle values.
Which objects share an arena follows from their handles alone.
With one byte signals, arena 0 holds `s0`, arena 1 holds `s1` to `s9`,
arena 2 holds `s10` to `s17`, and arena 3 starts at `s18`.
Found by `t6_sig20`.

A generic or a loop index has a handle outside the signal sequence,
and lands in whatever arena that handle names.
`t5_tr1000` has the loop index at `0xdf8`, arena 1, key `0x5f8`, and
arena 1 holds nothing else.


## Arena records and pages

The page directory has one `0x4c0` byte record per arena, described in
[container.md](container.md).
The record lists the file offset and the compressed length of each page
of that arena, up to 100 pages.

A page inflates to exactly 10240 bytes, the page size named in the
trailer:

| Offset | Size | Meaning |
| ---: | ---: | :--- |
| `0` | 8 | `t0`, the time of the first record, in ps |
| `8` | 8 | `t1`, the time of the last record minus `t0` |
| `16` | 4 | `n`, the number of records |
| `20` | | `n` records, then zero padding to 10240 |

A record is:

| Offset | Size | Meaning |
| ---: | ---: | :--- |
| `0` | 8 | time in ps |
| `8` | 4 | key |
| `12` | 4 | length of the value in bytes |
| `16` | | the value |

There is no alignment between records.
A one byte value makes a 17 byte record.

`t1` was found by `t5_tr1000`.
Its page 0 has `t0` 0 and `t1` 599000, with records at every 1000 ps
from 0 to 599000.
Its page 1 has `t0` 600000 and `t1` 400000, with the last record at
1000000.
A page holding one record at time 0 has both words 0.

Records are written in simulation order.
Two objects that change at the same time appear in declaration order,
which is also handle order, found by `t2_flat3`, where `bravo` and
`charlie` change together at 50 ns.


## Overflow

A page holds 600 one byte records: 20 bytes of header and 600 times 17
is 10220, and a 601st would not fit.
`t5_tr1000` writes 1001 records for its signal and fills pages of 600
and 401.
`t6_tr1300` writes 1301 and fills pages of 600, 600 and 101.
The arena record of arena 0 lists 2 and 3 pages.

The page that overflowed was written before the end of the simulation,
so it sits before the marker in the file, and the pages written at the
end follow the marker.
`t5_tr1000` has page 0 at `0x133b`, the marker at `0x1bac`, and page 1
at `0x1bbc`.
`t6_tr1300` has pages 0 and 1 first, the marker at `0x23f8`, and page 2
at `0x2408`.
The page directory is written last and points at all of them, so a
reader that follows the directory does not care about the order.

Whether a page of larger values holds fewer records, so that the limit
is the byte size and not the count, has not been separated by an
experiment.
The 10240 byte page size and the observed 600 records agree with a byte
limit, and 600 is not otherwise a round number, so that reading is the
working assumption.


## Value encodings

The value bytes of a record are the object's whole value after the
change.
There is no delta encoding.
The length is the declaration's value size, word 4 of the declaration
record, in every corpus case.

| Type | Encoding |
| :--- | :--- |
| enumeration | 1 byte, the literal's index in the type's list |
| `integer` and its subtypes | int32 |
| `real` | float64 |
| `time` | int64 in ps |
| array | elements back to back, left index first |
| record | fields in declaration order, aligned, total rounded up to 8 |

Enumeration covers `bit`, `std_ulogic`, `boolean`, `character` and user
types, found by `t1_nine_state`, `t2_boolean`, `t2_character` and
`t2_enum`.
The integer encoding was found by `t2_integer`, with 165 stored as
`a5 00 00 00`.
`t2_real` stores 1.5 as `0x3ff8000000000000`.
`t2_time` stores `7 ns` as 7000.
Arrays were found by `t1_vec8`, `t2_array2d` and `t5_int_arr`.
Records were found by `t2_record`, `t5_rec_real` and `t5_arr_rec`.

`std_ulogic` indexes are `U X 0 1 Z W L H -`, so `0` is 2 and `1` is
3.
That is the order in the type table and the order in the IEEE source.

A 2D array is stored with the first index outermost.
`t2_array2d` is `array (0 to 3) of std_ulogic_vector(7 downto 0)`, 32
bytes, and row 0 comes first, with its bit 7 first.

Alignment inside a record was separated by the tier 5 cases:

| Case | Record | Layout | Size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| `t5_arr_rec` | `std_ulogic`, `integer` | `0`, `4` | 8 |
| `t5_rec_real` | `std_ulogic`, `real`, `integer` | `0`, `8`, `16` | 24 |
| `t5_rec_sub5` | record of 5 bytes, `std_ulogic` | `0`, `8` | 16 |
| `t2_record_nested` | record of 9 bytes, `std_ulogic` | `0`, `16` | 24 |

So an integer is aligned to 4, a real to 8, and a record field is
aligned to 8 whatever it holds.
The total is rounded up to 8.
An array of records uses that rounded size as its stride: the three
`pair_t` of `t5_arr_rec` are at 0, 8 and 16.

A record field of record type carries an extra range triple `(0, 8, 1)`
in the type table, and the 8 matches the alignment.
Whether it is the alignment or something else is open, because both a
5 byte and a 9 byte inner record produce 8.
See [types.md](types.md).


## Which objects get records

| Object | Records |
| :--- | :--- |
| signal | one at time 0 with the initial value, then one per change |
| generic | one at time 0 with the value |
| loop index | one at time 0 holding 0 |
| variable declared in a process | none |

A signal that never changes has exactly one record, found by
`t0_bit_const`.
`t3_late` puts its only change at 1000 ns, and the page holds two
records, at 0 and 1000000.

The initial value at time 0 is the declared default or the type's
leftmost literal.
`t1_nine_state` starts at `U`, index 0.

The trailer's end time is the time of `std.env.stop`, not the last
change.
`t3_late` ends at 1010000 with its last record at 1000000, and
`t6_tr1300` ends at 1310000 with its last record at 1300000.


## What VCD cannot hold

Vivado's own VCD writer emits nothing for `boolean`, `integer`, `real`,
`time`, `character`, user enumerations, records or arrays other than
bit vectors.
Every one of those types is present in the pages with the encodings
above.
So the pages are the only record of those values, and the VCD guard in
[../provenance.md](../provenance.md) covers only the bit and vector
rows of the table.
